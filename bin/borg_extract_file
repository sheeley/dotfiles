# Purpose: Extract specific files from the latest BorgBackup archive
# This script finds the most recent backup with prefix 'johnny' and extracts
# specific files or directories passed as arguments
# Used to: Selectively restore files from a BorgBackup archive without restoring
#          the entire backup, saving time and disk space
set -euo pipefail # x

# WARNING: This always extracts to the current directory
# borg extract /path/to/repo::my-files

# Verify whether an archive could be successfully extracted, but do not write files to disk
# borg extract --dry-run /path/to/repo::my-files

# Extract the "src" directory
# borg extract /path/to/repo::my-files home/USERNAME/src

# Get the latest archive with prefix 'johnny'
LATEST=$(borg list --prefix johnny --last 1 --format='{archive}')
# CURRENT_DIR="$(pwd | cut -c 2-)"

# Extract the specified files/directories (passed as arguments) from the latest archive
borg extract "::$LATEST" "$@"
