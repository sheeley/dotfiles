# Purpose: Remove deleted files from git tracking
# This script automatically removes files that have been deleted from the filesystem
# but are still tracked by git, then shows the current git status
# Used to: Quickly clean up git tracking after deleting files manually,
#          saving time compared to removing each file individually with git rm
set -euo pipefail # x

# Remove all files that have been deleted from the filesystem but are still tracked by git
git rm "$(git ls-files --deleted)"
# Show current git status after removal
git status
