# Purpose: Safely force push git changes to remote
# This script uses git's force-with-lease option which is safer than a regular force push
# as it prevents overwriting others' work that you haven't seen yet
# Used to: Update remote branches after rebasing or amending commits locally,
#          while still maintaining safety checks to prevent data loss
set -euo pipefail # x

# Push changes with force-with-lease for safety
git push --force-with-lease
