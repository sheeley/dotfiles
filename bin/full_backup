# This script verifies the backup repository exists, runs the backup with
# caffeinate to prevent sleep, and logs the process
# Used to: Create complete system backups while providing detailed logging
#          and preventing the system from sleeping during the backup process

# Ensure backup volume is mounted before doing anything

# Set up logging

# Run borgmatic with caffeinate to prevent system sleep during backup

# Optional: Sync backup to remote storage
# caffeinate -i rclone sync -v /Volumes/money/borgbackup/ borgbase:repo --progress

# Optional: Unmount the backup disk after completion
